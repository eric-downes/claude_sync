16. Foramlizing 〈 .. 〉fill in the details and formalize the proof of the composition closure monad for actions in any topos with an NNO
17. Information CohomologyCohomology cocycles are not trivial.  the first couple are straightforward, but higher differentials have interesting forms.... can these forms help fix tertiary mutual information?
18. ker(Rost)
19. Magma Closures --> OOP2 --> E8 --> KervaireTrying to leverage the composition-closure monad to calculate E8 as an automorphism of octooctonionic space without fore-knowledge of E8.  This might then be used to construct the Kervaire invariant space in the appropriate dimension.
